In the Autumn of last year we had regular visits from a female Redstart. She would turn up in the evenings and flutter around on our terrace. Finally, she would find a spot sitting on top of the outside thermometer of our little weather station. As the nights got colder she would puff her feathers up to keep in the warmth. The thermometer is a small plastic box a few centimeters square. Still that was her place and she seemed to like it. We thought about making her a little platform under the roof so that she could perch more comforably.

Then one day when the weather started to turn cold she was gone. We were a little sad that she  was not there anymore but happy that she was on her way to her winter quarters.

Redstarts tend to return early in the Spring and sure enough she turned up as the weather warmed and went back to her perch on the thermometer. This time she had brought a friend. The darker male also found a space on a piece of pipework and started to over night there too. 

With two visitors now we decided to make them welcome. A triangular piece of plywood and a few angle brackets made a nice platform for the pair we thought. But while they took a close look at the new furniture they kept to their chosen small perches.

The Spring continued and we noticed material being transported to the plywood. Sure enough a nest was taking shape.

Last week the four Redstarts left the nest and started their adventure. We wish them all the best.
