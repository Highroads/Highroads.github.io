title: Some tindersticks thoughts
---

Just spent some time listening to the [tindersticks](http://www.tindersticks.co.uk/ "tindersticks") new album *The Waiting Room*. They still maintain that high level of melancholy that I remember from the first albums. I also know from seeing them live that they don't take themselves that seriously.
